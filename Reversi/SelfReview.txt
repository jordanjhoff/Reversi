Submit a second, smaller review of your experience of this exercise. This review should include the
following two aspects:

What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation? Did you learn any lessons
from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your customers?
What was your experience like with your providers?
Name this file SelfReview.txt and put it in the same directory as your README file.


We enjoyed this exercise of the code swap. This assignment was a useful exercise in reading and
implementing external code into your codebase, a commonly used skill. We thought the design of our
providers made the implementation straightforward. What we noticed was that even though they had
comments explaining something that was probably so intuitive to them, it was still quite
confusing to us coming in blind. From this assignment I have learned that you can never be too
thorough in documentation, as should definitely err on the side of too much detail rather than not
enough.

At the time of writing this, our customers have not reached out to us yet regarding updates
or clarification, which is a good sign. And when we asked our providers for clarification, they
promptly responded in detail with clarification, which was very appreciated.
