Player Interface:

1. A method that returns the players color
   (regardless whether the player is an ai or not, they have a team color)

2. A method that makes a move
        - takes in coordinates (may either be q/r/s or of some other form tbd)

3. A method that checks whether it is the players turn




what we need to do for next homework

ability to create copy of a board
readonly interface (just the observer methods)
Is it legal for the current player to play at a given coordinate?
What is the current score for either player?


You will likely need to design at least one, and possibly two,
interfaces for your view: one should describe what the frame
ought to be capable of, and one might be needed to describe
what the panel ought to be capable of. (These may be empty
interfaces for now, if you do not see a need for any methods
in them yet...but keep reading below for additional ideas.)
Note that your textual rendering from the previous assignment
does not have to implement this new GUI view interface, and
you do not have to force it to do so.
